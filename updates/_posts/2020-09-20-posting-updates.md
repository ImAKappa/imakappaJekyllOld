School is back in session, so I'll be posting less frequently. I'm working on a video for Twitter for Android (the sheet music is available right now though!). I'm surprised at the amount of people that watch my stuff. It's pretty cool. I wish I had more time to make videos.

I'm planning on keep my sheet music free forever. I might implement some way to donate if you want, but I don't know how to integrate that into websites yet. I thought about putting ads on this site, but they are pretty obnoxious. But these are problems for a future me to deal with.

I'm having fun creating this site. It is really frustrating at times, but also satisfying. If you have any suggestions to improve the site. You can email me at imaninonsp1cuouskappa@gmail.com
