    <p>A kappa is a turtle demon from East Asian folklore</p>
    <p>Basically, it is a spirit-demon that looks like a humanoid turtle. It has a small pool of water in a dent in it's head</p>
    <p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_(folklore)">Wikipedia</a> for more info.</p>
    <p>One of my nicknames is 'kappa'. So I've adopted it as my internet pseudonym.</p>
    <p class="hidden-text-light">I'm not actually a turtle demon though.</p>

    <p>I play the piano</p>
    <p>I took lessons for about 8 years. I stopped taking lessons, but I still continue to play since then.</p>
    <p>I play mainly classical music, since that is what I was taught</p>
    <p class="hidden-text-dark">And meme songs, of course</p>

    <p>I like computers</p>
    <p>I also like programming. I made this website from scratch.</p>
    <p class="hidden-text-light">That's also why this site is not so good ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
